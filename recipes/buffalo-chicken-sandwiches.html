            Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            This crockpot Buffalo chicken
            is great for hearty sandwiches
            that will please those who love
            Buffalo chicken wings. This
            recipe is perfect for those days
            spent watching football. I like
            to top these with 
            blue cheese or ranch dressing.
